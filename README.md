I have created an encrypted image by using steganography

the secret code: hello this message goin to be locked passkey is 654321 for this project Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

Overview:
This project focuses on image-based steganography, where a secret message is concealed within an image at the pixel level. The hidden message can later be retrieved using the correct passkey.

Key Features:

Hide a confidential message inside an image
Modify pixel values to encode the message
Decrypt the message only with the right passkey
Utilizes OpenCV for image manipulation
Project Structure:

Secure_Data_Hiding_In_Images_Using_Steganography
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ secure_data_hiding.py # Main script
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üñº Image.jpg # Original image (used for encoding)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üñº encryptedImage.jpg # Image with hidden message (output)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ README.md # Documentation

Installation & Setup:
1Ô∏è Prerequisites:

Install Python (version >=3.7)
Install OpenCV by running:
pip install opencv-python  
2Ô∏è Running the Script:

Place the image you want to use (Image.jpg) into the project folder.
Open a terminal and execute:
python secure_data_hiding.py  
Enter the secret message and passkey when prompted.
The script will produce the encrypted image, saved as encryptedImage.jpg.
Run the script again and enter the passkey to decrypt and retrieve the original message.
How It Works:

Encoding:

The script loads an image using OpenCV.
It converts each character of the secret message into pixel values.
Pixels are altered in a non-sequential pattern to store the hidden message.
Decoding:

If the correct passkey is provided, the script reads the pixel values and reconstructs the original message.
Limitations:

Works best with uncompressed image formats like .png or .bmp.
JPEG compression may alter pixel values, potentially affecting the decryption process.
The message length is limited by the size of the image.
Example Usage:

Encryption:

Enter Secret Code To Unlock: hello123
Enter The Passkey: secret12
The message has been hidden inside encryptedImage.jpg.

Decryption:

Enter passcode for Decryption: secret12
Decrypted message: hello123
Message successfully retrieved!

Security Considerations:

The encryption used in this method is relatively simple and does not rely on advanced cryptographic techniques.
For enhanced security, you may want to apply AES encryption to the message before embedding it into the image.
